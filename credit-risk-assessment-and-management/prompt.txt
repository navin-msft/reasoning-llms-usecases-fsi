  <instruction>A bank is considering whether to approve a $200,000 mortgage loan for a customer who wants to buy a house. The bank has the following information about the customer:</instruction>
  <instruction>Review the customer's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, employment status, income, savings, other debts, and the house information</instruction>
  <instruction>Assign a rating for each criterion based on the customer and the house information</instruction>
  <instruction>Combine the ratings for each criterion to form a composite rating</instruction>
  <instruction>Look up the maximum loan amount and the minimum interest rate for the composite rating in the policy table</instruction>
  <instruction>Compare the requested loan amount and the offered interest rate with the policy limits</instruction>
  <instruction>Decide whether to approve or reject the loan application based on the comparison and other factors</instruction>
  <instruction>If you need to make assumptions, approve or decline the loan and list the conditions that must first be validated before this decision can be made.</instruction>
</instructions>

</house_information>

<credit_risk_assessment_model>
The bank uses a credit risk assessment model that assigns a rating from A to D based on the following criteria:

- Credit score: A (700 or above), B (650-699), C (600-649), D (below 600)
- Debt-to-income ratio: A (below 30%), B (30-39%), C (40-49%), D (50% or above)
- Loan-to-value ratio: A (below 70%), B (70-79%), C (80-89%), D (90% or above)
- Employment status: A (full-time, stable), B (full-time, variable), C (part-time, stable), D (part-time, variable or unemployed)
- Market trend: A (rising, high demand, low inventory), B (stable, moderate demand, low inventory), C (stable, moderate demand, high inventory), D (declining, low demand, high inventory)

The bank also uses a credit risk assessment policy that defines the maximum loan amount and the minimum interest rate for each rating combination, as shown in the table below:

| Rating | Maximum loan amount | Minimum interest rate |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| AAAAA  | $500,000            | 3.5%                  |
| AAAAB  | $450,000            | 3.75%                 |
| AAAAC  | $400,000            | 4%                    |
| AAAAD  | $350,000            | 4.25%                 |

<credit_risk_assessment_process>
The bank's credit risk assessment process involves the following steps:

1. Assign a rating for each criterion based on the customer and the house information. For example, the customer has a credit score of 720, which corresponds to a rating of A for the credit score criterion.
2. Combine the ratings for each criterion to form a composite rating. For example, the customer has ratings of A, B, C, and A for the credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and employment status criteria, respectively. The house has a rating of B for the market trend criterion. The composite rating is ABACA.
3. Look up the maximum loan amount and the minimum interest rate for the composite rating in the policy table. For example, the composite rating of ABACA has a maximum loan amount of $300,000 and a minimum interest rate of 4.25%.
4. Compare the requested loan amount and the offered interest rate with the policy limits. For example, the customer requests a loan amount of $200,000 and the bank offers an interest rate of 4%, which are both within the policy limits.
5. Decide whether to approve or reject the loan application based on the comparison and other factors, such as the customer's credit history, savings, and other debts. For example, the bank may approve the loan application because the customer has a good credit history, sufficient savings, and manageable other debts, and the loan amount and interest rate are within the policy limits. Alternatively, the bank may reject the loan application because the customer has a high debt-to-income ratio, a low loan-to-value ratio, and a risky market trend, and the loan amount and interest rate are close to the policy limits.
